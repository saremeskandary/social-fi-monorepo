### Directories

1. **actors**: Contains the main actor for the social media dapp, which will handle all the business logic.
2. **types**: Defines the data structures and types used throughout the dapp.
3. **utils**: Includes any helper functions or utility modules used by the dapp.
4. **tests**: Houses the test suite for the social media dapp.
5. **scripts**: Holds deployment and other utility scripts.

### Files

1. **SocialMediaDapp.mo**: The main actor that implements the social media functionality, such as creating posts, retrieving posts, and managing user interactions.
2. **PostTypes.mo**: Defines the data structures for posts, including the post content, author, and timestamp.
3. **Helpers.mo**: Implements any utility functions or helpers used throughout the dapp.
4. **main.mo**: The entry point of the dapp, which may handle initialization or other top-level functionality.
5. **SocialMediaDappTests.mo**: The test suite for the social media dapp, including unit tests and integration tests.
6. **deploy.sh**: A script to deploy the dapp to the Internet Computer.
7. **dfx.json**: The configuration file for the Internet Computer development environment.
8. **README.md**: Provides documentation for the project, including setup instructions, usage, and any other relevant information.

### Development Workflow

1. **Design and Planning**: Establish the overall architecture, data model, and key features of the social media dapp.
2. **Implementation**: Develop the `SocialMediaDapp` actor, the data types, and any utility functions needed.
3. **Testing**: Create a comprehensive test suite to ensure the dapp's functionality and correctness.
4. **Deployment**: Use the `deploy.sh` script to package and deploy the dapp to the Internet Computer.
5. **Iteration and Maintenance**: Continuously improve the dapp based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

This structure provides a solid foundation for building a fully on-chain social media dapp on the Internet Computer. As you progress through the development, you may need to add additional components, such as user management, authentication, or advanced features. But this initial setup should give you a good starting point.
